# tablet-precision.sh - drawing-tablet "precision mode" toggle for KDE Plasma 6
# on Wayland. Part of plasma-wacom-center (MIT).
#
# Usage: tablet-precision.sh [toggle|resize|where|suspend|resume|heal|pause]   (default: toggle)
#
# toggle ON:  maps the pen to a TABLET-SHAPED rectangle (width = SCALE of the
#      screen, height follows the tablet's own aspect ratio, so there is no
#      stretch inside the area), placed so the cursor DOES NOT MOVE:
#      rect = norm * (screen - rect), the rule Wacom's Windows driver uses -
#      the area drifts toward a border slower than the cursor and can never
#      leave the screen. Pen position comes from tablet-pen-pos.py; the mouse
#      cursor is the fallback. A click-through overlay dims everything
#      OUTSIDE the mapped rectangle (tablet-overlay.py + .qml).
# toggle OFF: restores the mapping that was active before ON (not blindly
#      full screen). Toggle state = the state file, not the area value.
# toggle while ON with a FRESH relocate marker ($RD/relocate, under 3 s
#      old): a MOVE, not OFF - re-map at the pen's current position, the
#      saved base mapping stays. tablet-hover.py keeps the marker fresh while
#      it drags the live overlay after the pen (finger held on the key), so
#      the press that ends the drag lands the area where the overlay is.
# resize: while ON, the area takes the SCALE from the conf around ITS OWN
#      CENTRE, clamped to the screen (the ring size control calls this): the
#      area does not move, the base mapping saved at ON is kept. The cursor
#      scales with the area - the pen's place IN the area is what stays put,
#      not its place on the screen. No-op when OFF.
# where:  print "X Y W H DIM SW SH" - the rectangle a toggle ON would map right now,
#      nothing changed (tablet-hover.py draws the ghost from it).
# suspend / resume: while ON, put the base mapping back for the moment /
#      re-map the area on record - tablet-hover.py brackets a relocation with
#      them, so the cursor roams the whole screen while the area is aimed and
#      returns to the old area on a cancel (a confirm re-maps through toggle).
# heal:   tablet-hover.py runs it whenever a tablet appears (a connect, a
#      wake, a bus switch, its own start). ON: the pen that turned up takes
#      the area on record, so the mode survives a cable swap. OFF: a recent
#      pause resumes (see pause); otherwise nothing to do - see below.
# pause WHEN: tablet-hover.py runs it when the tablet has been GONE for its
#      grace (10 s) with the mode ON - switched off, a flat battery. It ends
#      the mode here without a pen, so no rectangle stays drawn with no
#      tablet, and keeps the area in $RD/paused. heal, or the key, within the
#      conf's RECONNECT seconds of WHEN resumes it at the SAME area; later, or
#      with RECONNECT=0, the record is dropped. $RD dies at logout, so a crash
#      never leaves a pause behind.
#
# KWin writes every outputArea it is given straight into kcminputrc, under
# [Libinput][vendor][product][name], and loads it again whenever that device
# appears. Over USB and over Bluetooth the tablet is two devices there. A
# precision rectangle would therefore outlive an unplug, a bus switch, a
# logout and a crash, while the only note saying it was temporary lives in
# $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR and dies with the session. So every RECTANGLE write goes
# through map_area, which writes the BASE back to kcminputrc at once
# (unpersist) and reads it back to prove it: the rectangle exists only in
# KWin's memory, and the file always names the mapping the pen must have
# with the mode OFF. Measured on Plasma 6.6, 2026-09-12: the write-back does
# not disturb the live mapping, and the pen stays in the rectangle.
#      The ledger, $XDG_STATE_HOME/tabprec/<vendor>-<product> (default
#      ~/.local/state), is now only a fallback: map_area writes one when the
#      write-back cannot be proved, and heal OFF repairs from it as before.
#
# The overlay is spawned once per ON with --fifo $RD/overlay.fifo and then
# MOVED through that pipe on a resize or a move (no respawn, no flicker);
# the geometry of the current mapping is kept in $RD/area for the daemon.
# Runs are serialized with flock on $RD/lock: two runs never interleave (a
# long press on the pad key = KWin's MOVE toggle, then the daemon's OFF).
# The conf is read after the lock and a resize that finds its width already
# on screen does nothing, so a burst of ring ticks (one process each, every
# 5 degrees) collapses into two resizes instead of a staircase; the pen's
# sysname is cached in $RD/pen (one D-Bus call to confirm it per run, not
# one per device).
#
# Config: ~/.config/tabprec.conf - SCALE (0.05-0.80 of screen width), DIM
# (0-0.8). Wacom Center and tablet-precision-size.sh write it. Silent by
# design: the overlay is the feedback; only errors notify.
#
# Devices are found by capability (tabletTool property), not by name, and
# looked up on every run - Bluetooth reconnects renumber the event nodes.
#
# Assumption: the base mapping is the default full-tablet stretch. If you set
# a letterboxed mapping on the Display page, the cursor-stationary math needs
# the inputArea transform added.
#
# Bind the toggle to a pad button through chords built from F-KEYS AND
# MODIFIERS ONLY: KWin's rebind injector resolves letters through the active
# keyboard layout, so letter chords die silently under any non-Latin layout.
